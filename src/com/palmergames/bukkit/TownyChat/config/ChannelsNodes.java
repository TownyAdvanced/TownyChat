			"# ----------",
			"# channeltag is what defines how the chatconfig.yml's {channelTag} chat tag will appear in the channel.",
			"#","#",
			"# PERMISSION",
			"# ----------",
			"# permission is an optional key in a channel, when it is set the given value will be the permission node required to listen/speak in the channel. It is used",

			"# FOCUSABLE",
			"# ---------",
			"# focusable is a setting which allows players to set their focused channel, ie: using the /tc command with no message. Channels are focusable by default, so",
